# Guide for agents: install and use git-builder

This doc helps automated or augmented agents (CLI agents, IDEs, MCP clients) install, build, test, and use git-builder correctly.

## What git-builder is

A Go CLI daemon that polls configured git repositories (clone or pull with depth 1), then runs `.git-builder.sh` in each repo when it has new commits. Supports SSH and HTTPS (GitHub token). Can be installed as a service via `--install` (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS).

## Installation (for users)

- **From a release:** Download the binary for the target OS/arch from [Releases](https://github.com/Leopere/git-builder/releases) and put it on `PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`).
- **From source:** `git clone` this repo, then `go build -o git-builder .` or `make build`. Then run `./git-builder --install` to install and start the service (optional).

Config: copy `config.example.yaml` to the config path (env `GIT_BUILDER_CONFIG` or default `/etc/git-builder/config.yaml`) and set `workdir`, `repos`, and optionally `ssh_key` or `github_token` / `GIT_BUILDER_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Commands (for agents working in this repo)

Use finite, non-interactive commands only (no interactive prompts).

- **Build:** `go build -o git-builder .` or `make build`
- **Test:** `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=60s`
- **Release (local):** `./release.sh <tag>` (e.g. `./release.sh v0.1.4`) — requires `gh`; builds 10 OS/arch binaries and runs `gh release create`
- **Ship:** Commit changes, then `git push origin main`. For a versioned release: `git tag v0.1.4 && git push origin v0.1.4`

## Repo conventions

- No interactive CLI; use finite commands or nohup. No long-running search in agent invocations.
- Avoid changing Docker files; do not modify production Dockerfiles unless necessary.
- Keep files under 400 lines; split into subpackages when needed.
- Prefer git versioning over backups or duplicate copies.
- Original author: Colin Knapp — keep attribution in README and LICENSE.

## Code layout

- `main.go` — flags, daemon loop, parallel poll (`max_concurrent`), SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 job state
- `config/` — YAML config: `MaxConcurrent`, workdir, SSH key, token, repos
- `gitops/` — sync (clone/pull)
- `run/` — run `.git-builder.sh` in repo root (or `local_override_dir`/`OWNER-REPO.sh` if set)
- `svc/` — pid/state files, install/uninstall, ListJobs/KillJobs
- Config example: `config.example.yaml`. Default config path: `GIT_BUILDER_CONFIG` or `/etc/git-builder/config.yaml`

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`): push to `main` → test, build, update `latest` release; push tag `v*` → test, build, versioned release. Use `gh run list`, `gh run view <id> --log-failed` to debug failures.

## MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) config for this project lives in **`.cursor/mcp.json`**. Cursor and Cloud Agents load that file automatically. It registers the **GitHub MCP server** so agents can work with releases, issues, and PRs.

**What you need to use MCP in this repo:**

- **Node/npx** — the GitHub server is run via `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`.
- **Cursor** (or another MCP client) — project config is read from `.cursor/mcp.json`.
- **GitHub token** — set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your environment (e.g. in your shell profile or launch env). Do not put the token in `mcp.json` or any committed file. Restart Cursor after changing the variable so the MCP server sees it.

For full “how to operate this project” (build, test, release, and MCP), this file (AGENT.md) is the single place to look.
